# Process Assessment Document - Team 13
## Premise
This Process Assessment is being prepared as part of a project audit by an independent quality organization. The purpose of this audit is to assess the effectiveness of the software development team that developed a Java project for Professor Lauren . The software calculates the average sentence length in student papers. In cooperation with this Audit the team has submitted the following:
<ul>
<li>The team's deliverable documents and source code</li>
<li>The team's defect log</li>
<li>The team's time record</li>
</ul>

## 1 Team members
<ul>
<li>Annette Spyker</li>
<li>David Faour</li>
<li>James Jennings</li>
<li>Tamara Wright Muccia</li>
</ul>

## 2 Process used
This project was planned to follow the waterfall lifecyle methodology with slight modification. 

Planned Modifications from Waterfall:
<ol>
<li>The Requirements Gathering interview was completed prior to project kickoff by an outside entity. 
<li>Due to travel plans of the Business Analyst the Requirements Documentation will be completed in parallel with Process documentation. 
</ol>

It was anticipated this should not present a problem as project process and schedule were defined during the project kickoff and only needed to be documented. 

... need to fill in how we did against this ...

## 6 Recommendations:
prioritized bullet list of recommendations on how to improve the team's software development process.

## 7 Summary:
One-paragraph summary of the assessment.

## Caveat
You are assessing your own team, so you have a conflict of interest: the more problems you detect with your team's process, the worse your team looks. That is why I have structured this exercise as if you were an independent team from a separate organization. It is your job to be objective. The TA and I will also be evaluating the development team's process. The closer your evaluation score is to ours, the better you will do on this exercise. So be critical but fair.
