## 2 Process Description

### 2.1 Project Lifecycle
This project will follow the waterfall lifecyle methodology where possible. Due to travel plans of the Business Analyst the Requirements Documentation will be completed in parallel with Process documentation. This should not be an issue as 1) requirements gathering was performed prior to project kickoff by different resources and 2) project process and schedule was defined during the project kickoff.
