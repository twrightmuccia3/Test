# Process Assessment Document - Team 13
## Premise
This Process Assessment is being prepared as part of a project audit by an independent quality organization. The purpose of this audit is to assess the effectiveness of the software development team that developed a Java project for Professor Lauren . The software calculates the average sentence length in student papers. In cooperation with this Audit the team has submitted the following:
<ul>
<li>Deliverable documents</li>
<li>Source code</li>
<li>Defect logs</li>
<li>Time records</li>
</ul>

## 1 Team members
<ul>
<li>Annette Spyker</li>
<li>David Faour</li>
<li>James Jennings</li>
<li>Tamara Wright Muccia</li>
</ul>

## 2 Process used
This project was planned to follow the waterfall lifecyle methodology with slight modification. 

Planned Modifications from Waterfall:
<ol>
<li>The Requirements Gathering interview was completed prior to project kickoff by an outside entity. 
<li>Due to travel plans of the Business Analyst the Requirements Documentation will be completed in parallel with Process documentation. 
</ol>

It was anticipated this should not present a problem as project process and schedule were defined during the project kickoff and only needed to be documented. As anticipated, this small modificatin to the Waterfall Methodology did not cause any issues.

The process was followed as outlined. However there were shifts in timing.

As mention previously the updates to the Test Plan to show test results was late in being completed because of unexpected outside time constraints on one of the team members. The test had been completed and results communicated via email, so the Auditor felt safe to begin the Audit. In the real world this would have been a decision point to determine if that risk was acceptable or if the customer would allow the deadline to slip in order to preserve process. I feel comfortable that the same choice would have been made in real life.</td>

The Process Plan overestimated the time to complete the project. The Project Manager padded estimates to give slack to the schedule. While the time padding was not used, the schedule still became tight due to outside demands on resource time.

### Total lines of code in delivered product
<table>

	<tr>
		<td width=400 align="center"><b>File</b></td>
		<td width=275 align="center"><b>Lines of Code</b></td>

	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Actual lines of code was determined by counting the lines in the physical files. All lines were counted, even if the line was blank. Orginal projection was made prior to the design decision to split into multiple files and did not consider blank lines, comments or bracket only lines. Given these differences, I believe the lines of code delivered to be in line with the original estimate.

### Total lines of user documentation
<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td width=400 align="Center"><b>File</b></td>
		<td width=275 align="Center"><b>Lines of Documentation</b></td>

</table>
No projections were made related to lines of documentation, but the amount received seems sufficient.
